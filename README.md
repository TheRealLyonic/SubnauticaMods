# Introduction

Welcome! This is where you'll find the primary source code, as well as any direct download links, for my Subnautica-related mods.
There aren't many of them at the moment, but provided my motivation stays alive, that may change in the near future.

# Mod Links

## Subnautica
* [Improved Reaper](https://github.com/TheRealLyonic/SubnauticaMods/tree/main/ImprovedReaper) **(Allows the player to alter some of the properties of the Reaper Leviathan. A largely outdated mod, replaced entirely by the Improved Cragfield mod, but left separate for download as a result of popular request)**
* [Improved Cragfield](https://github.com/TheRealLyonic/SubnauticaMods/tree/main/ImprovedCragfield) **(Adds new terrain, extra resources, and a few more Reaper spawns to the Cragfields, aiming to make the neglected biome more interesting. Special thanks to Mayonnaise in the Subnautica Modding Discord for coming up with the idea for this mod, it would not exist without them!)**

## Subnautica: Below Zero
* [Heat Blade Warmth](https://github.com/TheRealLyonic/SubnauticaMods/tree/main/HeatBladeWarmthBZ) **(Adds new functionality to the Thermoblade in Below Zero, allowing the player to trigger an animation and warm themselves up, at the cost of some health)**

# References
These mods would not be possible without the amazing support from the individuals within the Subnautica Modding discord server, and all of the teaching resources they've compiled there. If you have any interest in modding Subnautica or Below Zero at all, I strongly encourage you to join, and get acquainted with some of the lovely people you'll find there! If you find a reference to some names you don't recognize throughout my source-code, chances are you'll find that person in the modding discord.
